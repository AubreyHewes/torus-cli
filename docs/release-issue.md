# Release Issue Template

This template contains the "original body" for a "release" issue. Copy, paste,
update, and submit!

Example: https://github.com/arigatomachine/cli/issues/791

For each RC (release candidate), append a new comment with a fresh copy of the
[qa checklist](./qa.md).

For each release, a [change log](./changelog.md) must be curated.
